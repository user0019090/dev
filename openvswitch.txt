Step 1: Check OVS installation

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openvswitch-switch -y
sudo systemctl status openvswitch-switch

Step 2: Create a Virtual Switch (bridge)

Create a bridge named br0:

sudo ovs-vsctl add-br br0

Step 3: Add your existing interfaces to OVS

You can attach your internal interface (enp0s8) and optionally the external NAT interface (enp0s3) to OVS.

To make OVS handle internal communication:

sudo ovs-vsctl add-port br0 enp0s8


If you also want your VM to have Internet access via OVS:

sudo ovs-vsctl add-port br0 enp0s3


Step 4: Assign IP address to the bridge

Since your interface enp0s8 currently holds 192.168.56.128, weâ€™ll move that IP to the bridge.

First, remove the IP from the physical interface:

sudo ip addr flush dev enp0s8


Assign it to the bridge:

sudo ip addr add 192.168.56.128/24 dev br0
sudo ip link set br0 up



Step 5: Verify setup

Check your configuration:

ip a
sudo ovs-vsctl show



Step 6: Test connectivity

If you have another VM in the same Host-only network (like 192.168.56.129), try pinging it:

ping 192.168.56.129


Step 7: Observe OVS details

You can explore your OVS switch:

sudo ovs-ofctl show br0
sudo ovs-ofctl dump-flows br0


Cleanup (if needed)

To remove the setup:

sudo ovs-vsctl del-br br0
